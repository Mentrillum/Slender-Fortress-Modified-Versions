//		This profiles example may contain outdated, incorrect or missing info. There is a lot of stuff in SF2 Modified, an insane amount of complexity that often requires high maintenance.
// 		This is the most accurate listing of boss config settings in Slender Fortress Modified, spanning as far back as post 0.2.8.
//		This guide is made for creators who want to submit bosses for any Slender Fortress Modified server.
//

// Slender Fortress - Boss Profiles
//
// A config rewriter is available to rewrite configs at: https://github.com/Mentrillum/Slender-Fortress-Config-Rewriter
//
// Here is where all data about a boss is put, such as their behavior, sanity increase/decrease rates, animations, appear chance, etc.
// Some fields are required to be put in the profile data, but most of them are optional. All values involving time are in seconds unless stated otherwise.
// Not all fields are required to be written in a boss's profile. Optional fields will have a default value.
//
// Any sections ( {} ) abbrieviated with "sound_" will have its contents automatically precached and put in the server downloads table. Some of them also have several keyvalues that
// allows you to change how the sound is played in the game, including channel, pitch, volume, level, cooldown_min, and cooldown_max. Of course, they're all optional, but this 
// mostly only applies to boss type 2 sounds and proxy sounds.
//
// For example: // See SOUND SECTIONS for more info
//
// 	"sound_chasingenemy"
//	{
//		"cooldown_min" "1.5"
//		"cooldown_max" "2.1"
//		"volume" "1.0" // Do not go over 1.0
//		"pitch" "100" // Values between 1 and 255 work, no decimals must be used.
//
//		"paths"
//		{
//			"1"	"cof/slowerno/idle1.wav"
//			"2"	"cof/slowerno/idle2.wav"
//		}
//	}
//
// Any other mentions of the word "section" involves sections of lines enclosed with braces ( {} ), like the example.
// Sections list their content one by one, each assigned by a number that increases as more content is inserted like the example. The content numbers HAVE to be in sequence,
// or else the gamemode might read a non-existent value and/or not be able to read that value at all. Some sections only support 1 content, which means no matter how much
// content you put into it only the first one will be read and used. They're noted in this guide.
//
// If you are familiar with VS. Saxton Hale/Freak Fortress 2, the mod_precache, mod_download, mat_download, and download sections works the same way. If you're not, there's more information
// about it below.
//
// Put the full path of a model or a material in mod_download or mat_download WITHOUT its extension, and all their associated extensions will be automatically be put into the downloads table.
// Any section that is prefixed with sound_ will automatically be precached and queued for downloading, so there's no need to put the sounds in a download section.
//
// If for any reason a download is missing, the plugin will print out a log file that can be found in addons/sourcemod/logs/sf2/, from there you can see which bosses have broken downloads. Single string downloads count as well.
// Broken downloads will not be downloaded, models will still be precached to avoid server crashing, and sounds will still be precached to avoid not precached sounds in the server.
//
// Sound channels:
// ---------------------------------------------------
// 0 = Auto - (The default value for most boss sounds)
// 1 = Weapons
// 2 = Voices
// 3 = Item
// 4 = Body (player?)
// 5 = Stream ("Stream channel from the static or dynamic area")
// 6 = Static ("Stream channel from the static area" - used by global sounds)
// 7 = Voice Base (channel for network voice data)
// ---------------------------------------------------

// 		BASE KEYVALUES			
// =============================================
// These values are mandatory, however certain values depends on the type of the boss.

// Companion Spawning allows for Bosses to spawn in additional bosses with them upon selection.
// This basically allows for dual or grouped bosses to be deployed for the round.
// The companion system has been reworked to support random companion groups to spawn with a defined chance and if new ones should spawn when the companion master spawns or when the difficulty changes.

// on_spawn means that as soon as the companion master spawns, the companions will also spawn once.
// on_difficulty_change means that once a difficulty change happens, a new companion group will be chosen and the old group will be removed.
// NOTE: This key value is critical and must always be placed in the companions section if you want to use the new companion spawning system.
// Failing to do so will result in the companions not spawning at all.
//
// "weight" - Determines the chance a group can spawn. Difficulty prefixes are supported.
// NOTE: You don't need to limit yourself to be in the 0% to 100% range, a higher weight means that group will have a much higher chance of spawning.

// =============================================
//		SOUND SECTIONS
// =============================================
// Sound sections have been completely reworked and require a new way to make them.
// Trying to use the old system just won't work.
// Every single sound section requires a sub "paths" section.
// See the attack data section for more info on how those work now.
// The available key values are "channel", "level", "pitch", "cooldown_min", "cooldown_max", "pitch_random_min", "pitch_random_max", "flags", and "volume"
//
// SECTIONS:
// "sound_idle" - Sound(s) that the boss will make while in an idle or a wandering state.
// "sound_alertofenemy" - Sound(s) that the boss will make while in an alert state.
// "sound_chasingenemy" - Sound(s) that the boss will make while chasing an enemy.
// "sound_chaseenemyinitial" - Sound(s) that the boss will make when it begins chasing an enemy.
// "sound_stun" - Sound(s) that the boss will make when it gets stunned.
// "sound_attackenemy" - Sound(s) that the boss will make when it attacks a player.
// "sound_attack_killed" - Sound(s) played locally when the boss kills a player.
// "sound_attack_killed_all" - Sound(s) played to everyone when the boss kills a player.
// "sound_attack_killed_client" - Sound(s) played to the player whenever the boss kills them.
// "sound_rage" - If the boss is a Boxing boss, the boss will play the sound(s) whenever it rages. If you want separate rage sounds for different phases, use "sound_rage_2" for phase 2 and "sound_rage_3" for phase 3.
// "sound_heal_self" - If the boss is a Boxing boss, the boss will play the sound(s) whenever it starts healing.
// "sound_move" - Looping sound that is played when the boss moves. Only for Boss Type 1. Only the first sound listed will be used.
// "sound_move_single" - A single sound that is played once the boss moves, DO NOT USE FOR LOOPING SOUNDS! Only for Boss Type 1.
// "sound_player_deathcam" - Sound(s) played to the player when the death-cam sequence starts.
// "sound_player_deathcam_all" - Sound(s) played to everyone when the death-cam sequence starts for a player from this boss.
// "sound_player_deathcam_local" - Sound(s) played on the boss when the death-cam sequence starts that every other player can hear.
// "sound_scare_player" - Sound(s) played to the player when he gets a scare.
// "sound_music" - Override the sound pages. Difficulty themes work as well, use "sound_music_hard", "sound_music_insane", "sound_music_nightmare", and "sound_music_apollyon".
// Side note, random themes are present, however once the boss spawns, you cannot update the difficulty back and forth to change the theme for a specific difficulty, they have to be fully removed and readded.
// "sound_music_loop" - NOT A SOUND SECTION. If a music set in the section "sound_music" is a .mp3 file you can use this key for loop it, or use 9999 like a lot of people do. Difficulty key values are supported.
// If set to 0, no music will play, but anything above that will play whatever most available sound_music is present.
// "sound_hitenemy" - Sound effect(s) that is played when the boss successfully hits an enemy with its melee attack.
// "sound_missenemy" - Sound effect(s) that is played when the boss ends up hitting nothing with its melee attack.
// "sound_attackshootprojectile" - Sound effect(s) that is played when the boss shoots their projectile with an attack.
// "sound_spawn_local" - If spawn_animation is set to 1, then the sound(s) here will be used whenever a boss spawns on a map.
// NOTE: This will be removed in 1.7.6
//
// "sound_static" - Looping sound that is played to the player when the boss starts draining his Sanity. Only the first sound listed will be used.
// "sound_static_loop_local_enabled" - NOT A SOUND SECTION. Boolean that determines if the layered "sound_static_loop_local" should play.
// "sound_static_loop_local" - A layered looping sound that is played to only the player when the boss starts draining their sanity. Only the first sound listed will be used.

// "sound_static_loop_local_volume_min" - NOT A SOUND SECTION. Float value that determines the minimum volume of "sound_static_loop_local".
// "sound_static_loop_local_volume_max" - NOT A SOUND SECTION. Float value that determines the maximum volume of "sound_static_loop_local".
//
// "sound_jumpscare" - Sound that is played to the player when the boss uses the Jumpscare feature against him. Only the first sound listed will be used.
//
// "sound_footsteps" - Sound(s) that are used to simulate boss movement.
// "sound_footsteps_event_%i" - Sound(s) that are used to simulate the boss' animation event with %i representing the animation event's integer. For instance, TF2's models use animation event 7001 to simulate footsteps, so you use sound_footsteps_event_7001.
// "sound_event_%i" - Similar story to sound_footsteps_event_%i excluding the use of footstep functions like earthquake footsteps.
//
// These next sections all can use another key value called "radius" which determine how far the music can be played from, all default to 850.0
// "sound_chase_music" - Looping sounds that will play when the boss is chasing a player, usually a song.
// "sound_chase_visible" - Looping sounds that will play alongside "sound_chase_music" when the boss can see the player.
// "sound_alert_music" - Looping sounds that will play when the boss is in alert mode, usually a song.
// "sound_idle_music" - Looping sounds that will play when the boss is close to a player while in idle mode, usually a song.
// "sound_20dollars" - Looping sounds that is played alongside "sound_chase_visible" when $20 is enabled. If not set and the special round is 20 Dollars, this will use a predefined music theme.
//
// Example:
//
// 	"sound_chasingenemy"
//	{
//		"cooldown_min" "1.5"
//		"cooldown_max" "2.1"
//		"volume" "1.0" // Do not go over 1.0

// 		CHAT MESSAGE UPON DEATH			
// =====================================================

// This is a basic, print to chat function that prints the Clients Name followed by a message from the bosses profile.
// It is fairly straight forward, yet could add some degree of personality or charm to the boss in question.
// NOTE: Chat messages can only be a maximum of 255 characters, so plan accordingly when writing your messages.
//
// This is how it looks in the profiles, this is a sample taken from Slender's profile.
// These messages will always print if the boss is considered as the inflictor upon the clients death.
//
// An example of how this would appear in would would be "[SF2] Player got killed by Slender."
//
// 		"chat_message_upon_death"
//		{
//			"1"	"[PLAYER] was caught by Slender."
//			"2"	"[PLAYER] angered Slender by taking his pages."
//			"3"	"[PLAYER] decided it was a good idea to take on Slender."
//			"4"	"[PLAYER] didn't know what they got themselves into."
//		}
//
//
// There is also "chat_message_upon_death_prefix" which allows you to change the prefix of the message.
// By default this uses "[SF2]", but can be changed to another prefix, such as "[SCP]".
//
// However, if this is missing from the profile. It will not attempt to print any messages.
// Ontop of that, if the boss is allowed to attack blue, it will also stop printing these messages to avoid spam.
//
// In addition to all of this, you have 3 special chat key values that you can use inside your death messages that'll do specific things to the chat messages.
// [PLAYER] filters in the player's name in the death message that can be placed anywhere rather than the start.
// [BOSS] filters in the boss' name, including difficulty names.
// [ROUNDTIME] filters in the round's time based on when grace period ended. This is an int value, not a float value.
//
// 		"chat_message_upon_death"
//		{
//			"1"	"[PLAYER] reported [BOSS] to Mentrillum, neither of them found it funny."
//			"2"	"[BOSS] thought it was ok to kill [PLAYER], which it indeed was."
//			"3"	"In [ROUNDTIME] seconds, [PLAYER] died."
//			"4"	"What more do you want [PLAYER], do you want to die more?"
//		}
//
// Finally, to spice up your chat messages, you can use chat colors. These ones can clutter your chat messages, so do be prepared.
// In order to use chat colors, you need to put in lets say {green} before all characters you want to be green for example. In game, all characters after {green} will be the color green.
// You don't even have to just use green, you can use a massive list of colors found in morecolors.inc. Simply find the function stock Handle:InitColorTrie() in the inc file and choose the color you want.
// All chat colors by default use {default}, not {white}. [PLAYER] is the only filter that has a predefined color system, its {red}[PLAYER]{default}.
// Actually determining the color value from morecolors.inc is easy as taking the third value from SetTrieValue and copying everything after 0x, then feeding that value in a color hex viewer.
//
// 		"chat_message_upon_death"
//		{
//			"1"	"[PLAYER], do you like {red}red death messages?{default} We've got you."
//			"2"	"[PLAYER], don't like {red}red death messages?{default} How about {blue}blue death messages{default}?"
//			"3"	"Still not sure [PLAYER]? Well you can use {green}green, {yellow}yellow, {purple}purple, {crimson}crimson, {default}and many more."
//			"4"	"You want to make [BOSS] the Valve color [PLAYER]? Boom, {valve}[BOSS]{default} is now the Valve color."
//          "5" "You want to make [ROUNDTIME] the Genuine color [PLAYER]? Boom, {genuine}[ROUNDTIME]{default} is now the Genuine player.
//		}
//
// In total, there are 174 colors to choose from (Counting {default}), so go crazy if you want. Colors also apply to "chat_message_upon_death_prefix".
// You can also use "chat_message_upon_death_difficulty_indexes" to determine what difficulties these death messages will appear, this uses the same system as the legacy damage effects attack index system. Defaults to 123456.
