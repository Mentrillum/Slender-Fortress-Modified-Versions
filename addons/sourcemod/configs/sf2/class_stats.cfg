// Slender Fortress Class Stats
//
// This is where server owners get to balance out class stats based off their preferences.
// Over time the base config will be updated to add new values that can be adjusted, so its best to add those stats in whenever they come in.
// This config can be reloaded in realtime without needing to reload the plugin and restarting the game. Use the developer command sm_sf2_reloadprofiles which will reload all configs plus this one.
//
// ============================
// SPEED KEY VALUES
// ============================
// "runspeed" - The unmodified sprint speed classes will run at if they don't see a boss, the value is multiplied if this scenario happens however.
// "walkspeed" - The unmodified walk speed classes will walk at if they don't see a boss, this value is also multiplied if the same scenario happens.
// "danger_speed_multiplier" - The multiplier used to multiply both the walk speed and sprint speed of classes if players are close to a boss, being chased, or saw a boss, not when theres no boss.
// "sprint_multiplier" - The multiplied sprint duration for each class. By default the drain rate is 0.28 seconds per sprint point, or 0.38 with the Coffee special round.
// "scare_sprint_multiplier" - How long players feel in danger after seeing a boss, close to a chasing boss, or were a target. By default the duration is 3 seconds which can then be multiplied with this key value.
// "sprint_loss_while_jumping" - How many sprint points are lost while jumping, if set to a value less than the default value then this will only affect non-sprint jumping.
//
// ============================
// HEALTH KEY VALUES
// ============================
// "proxy_damage_vulnerability" - A multiplier that'll be used to determine how much more damage a player can receive from proxies.
// "can_pickup_health" - This key value is ignored on Boxing maps. Outside of that, this will determine if a class can pick up a health kit.
// "health_pickup_multiplier" - A multiplier that determines how much health the class will receive from a health kit.
//
// ============================
// BOSS KEY VALUES
// ============================
// "boss_priority" - How much immediate priority is added to a class if a boss sees that class.
// "boss_hearing_multiplier" - A multiplier that determines how sensitive classes are to making noise. Lower numbers mean bosses will be able to hear certain classes easier.
//
// ============================
// BLINK KEY VALUES
// ============================
// "blink_rate_multiplier" - A multiplier that determines how long a player will take before blinking, higher numbers means it'll take longer for a certain class to blink.
//
// ============================
// STATIC KEY VALUES
// ============================
// "static_resistance_increase" - A multiplier that determines how much static will be built on the player if they look at a boss or get within the static radius. Lower numbers mean more static.
// "static_resistance_decrease" - A multiplier that determines how long it will take before all of the static is gone. Higher numbers mean it'll take longer for the static to fade away completely.
//
// ============================
// ULTRAVISION KEY VALUES
// ============================
// "ultravision_radius_multiplier" - This multiplier takes the current CVar for RED player's ultravision radius (600.0) and multiplies that by this key value.
// NOTE: If that same CVar is changed, that new CVar value will be multiplied by the key value. Same story will apply to the next key value.
// "ultravision_brightness_multiplier" - This multiplier takes the current CVar for RED player's ultravision brightness (-2) and multiplies that by this key value. Lower numbers mean brighter ultravision.
// "ultravision_fadein_timer" - A timer that determines how long it takes for each ultravision brightness increment to happen. Normally the default value is 0.1 due to Sourcemod's timer limitation, but 0.0 works just as fine.
//
// ============================
// NIGHT VISION KEY VALUES
// ============================
// "nightvision_radius_multiplier" - This multiplier takes the current CVar for RED player's night vision radius (900.0) and multiplies that by this key value.
// "nightvision_brightness_multiplier" - This multiplier takes the default night vision brightness (5) and multiplies that by this key value. Higher numbers mean brighter night vision.
//
// ============================
// FLASHLIGHT KEY VALUES
// ============================
// "flashlight_brightness" - An added variable that takes the default flashlight brightness (0) and adds that to this key value. Negative numbers can also be used.
// "flashlight_radius_multiplier" - This multiplier takes the default flashlight radius (512.0) and multiplies that by this key value.
// "flashlight_length_multiplier" - This multiplier takes the default flashlight length (1024.0) and multiplies that by this key value.
// "flashlight_damage_multiplier" - This multiplier determines how much damage will be applied to flashlight stunnable bosses based of their stun flashlight damage key value.
// "flashlight_drain_rate" - A multiplier that'll determine how long it'll take for each flashlight battery point is removed, by default the timer is 0.65 seconds.
// "flashlight_recharge_rate" - A multiplier that'll determine how long it'll take for each lost flashlight battery point to be reinstated, by default the timer is 0.68. Lower numbers mean a faster flashlight recharge rate.
// "flashlight_sound_radius" - A multiplier that'll determine how far bosses can hear flashlights, lower numbers equals better hearing.
//
// ============================
// SPECIAL ROUND KEY VALUES
// ============================
// "blocked_on_thanatophobia" - Determines if a class can be used on the special round Thanatophobia.
//
// ============================
// TRAP KEY VALUES
// ============================
// "immune_to_traps" - Determines if a class can get stuck in traps or not, this does not negate the 10 damage. And this will not alert any nearby bosses.
