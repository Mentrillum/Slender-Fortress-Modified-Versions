// Slender Fortress - Boss Profiles
//
// Here is where all data about a boss is put, such as their behavior, sanity increase/decrease rates, turnrate, animations, appear chance, etc.
// Some fields are required to be put in the profile data, but most of them are optional. All values involving time are in seconds unless stated otherwise.
// Not all fields are required to be written in a boss's profile. Optional fields will have a default value.
//
// Any sections ( {} ) abbrieviated with "sound_" will have its contents automatically precached and put in the server downloads table. Some of them also have several keyvalues that
// allows you to change how the sound is played in the game, including _channel, _pitch, _volume, _level, _cooldown_min, and _cooldown_max. Of course, they're all optional, but this 
// mostly only applies to boss type 2 sounds and proxy sounds.
//
// For example:
//
// 	"sound_chasingenemy"
//	{
//		"1"	"cof/slowerno/idle1.wav"
//		"2"	"cof/slowerno/idle2.wav"
//	}
//
//	"sound_chasingenemy_cooldown_min"	"1.5"
//	"sound_chasingenemy_cooldown_max"	"2.1"
//	"sound_chasingenemy_volume"	"0.7" //Do not go over 1.0
//	"sound_chasingenemy_pitch" "100" //Values between 1 and 255 work, no decimals must be used.
//
// Any other mentions of the word "section" involves sections of lines enclosed with braces ( {} ), like the example.
// Sections list their content one by one, each assigned by a number that increases as more content is inserted like the example. The content numbers HAVE to be in sequence,
// or else the gamemode might read a non-existent value and/or not be able to read that value at all. Some sections only support 1 content, which means no matter how much
// content you put into it only the first one will be read and used. They're noted in this guide.
//
// If you are familiar with VS. Saxton Hale/Freak Fortress 2, the mod_precache, mod_download, mat_download, and download sections works the same way. If you're not, there's more information
// about it below.
//
// Put the full path of a model or a material in mod_download or mat_download WITHOUT its extension, and all their associated extensions will be automatically be put into the downloads table.
// Any section that is prefixed with sound_ will automatically be precached and queued for downloading, so there's no need to put the sounds in a download section.
//
// If for any reason a download is missing, the plugin will print out a log file that can be found in addons/sourcemod/logs/sf2/, from there you can see which bosses have broken downloads. Single string downloads count as well.
// Broken downloads will not be downloaded, models will still be precached to avoid server crashing, and sounds will still be precached to avoid not precached sounds in the server.
//

// Currently some of the public bosses have been updated with the difficulty based animations. It is pretty straight forward to add to the bosses that don't utilize this system.
//
// Add into the same number as your desired animation with the _hard, _insane, _nightmare, & _apollyon prefixes for animations such as "animation_walk".
//
// NOTE: You will need to set "difficulty_affects_animations" to "1" in your boss profile in order to use difficulty based animations.
// NOTE2: This only applies for idle, walk, walk alert, and run animation sets, for everything else, it is completely ignored and no longer needed for all the other animations.
// NOTE3: You can use footstep intervals based on the difficulty for idle, walking, alert walking, and running. Make sure those values are set if you're gonna use difficulty affects animations and footsteps.
// NOTE4: If any of these values have blank values, then it will use the difficulty before what it is, so if its Nightmare and there is no animation for Nightmare, it'll use the Insane animation, goes all the way down to Normal.

// These messages will always print if the boss is considered as the inflictor upon the clients death.
//
// An example of how this would appear in would would be "[SF2] Player got killed by Slender."

// By default this uses "[SF2]", but can be changed to another prefix, such as "[SCP]".
